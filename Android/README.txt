1. Print the marker on a paper.
2. Start the Qsim server without running the simulation yet.
3. Open unity, build and Install the app on android phone.
4. Connect to a hotspot wifi from PC. (PC IP address in my case is 192.168.137.1)
	-If your IP is different then you have to change that in the unity project in the mainscript gameobject. Then rebuild the .apk.
5. The app should connect to the Qsim server once started. 
6. If connection is started then run the Qsim simulation.
